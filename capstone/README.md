# PayPal Transaction Dashboard Capstone Project

## Overview
In this capstone project, you'll build a complete transaction management application that demonstrates your mastery of Flutter development concepts. You'll combine the skills learned throughout the course to create a polished, production-ready mobile application.

## Time Required
5 hours

## Learning Objectives
By completing this capstone project, you will:
1. Integrate multiple Flutter concepts into a cohesive application
2. Apply secure state management patterns at scale
3. Implement protected navigation flows
4. Build production-ready error handling and loading states
5. Create a polished, responsive UI

## Prerequisites
- Completion of all course labs
- Flutter development environment set up
- Understanding of state management patterns
- Familiarity with navigation concepts

## Getting Started

1. Navigate to the starter code:
```bash
cd capstone/starter
```

2. Get dependencies:
```bash
flutter pub get
```

3. Run the starter app:
```bash
flutter run
```

## Submission Requirements

Your submission should include:
1. Complete source code
2. README with:
   - Setup instructions
   - Feature overview
   - Architecture decisions
   - Testing strategy
3. Unit tests for core functionality
4. Screenshots of key screens

## Tips for Success

1. Start with Architecture
   - Set up your project structure first
   - Define key interfaces and models
   - Plan your navigation flow

2. Incremental Development
   - Build one feature at a time
   - Test each component thoroughly
   - Refactor as needed

3. Focus on Core Requirements
   - Implement must-have features first
   - Add polish after core functionality works
   - Maintain clean architecture throughout

4. Testing Strategy
   - Write tests as you develop
   - Focus on critical business logic
   - Include error cases
