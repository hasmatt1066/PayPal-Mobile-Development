## Course Overview
This intensive 40-hour course is designed specifically for PayPal backend engineers to develop practical skills in cross-platform mobile application development. The course focuses on building robust, user-friendly applications that can run on multiple platforms including iOS, Android, Web, Windows, MacOS, and Linux.

## Learning Journey: The Big Picture

### Professional Development Approach
This course takes a unique "inside-out" approach to mobile development, starting with domain models and business logic rather than UI components. This professional approach:

- **Mirrors Real-World Development**: Enterprise applications begin with domain modeling and architecture, not UI design
- **Prioritizes Security**: Financial applications require robust security at the domain level
- **Ensures Maintainability**: Clean architecture principles lead to more maintainable codebases
- **Enables Testability**: Proper separation of concerns allows for comprehensive testing

```

The course follows a deliberate progression where each day builds upon the previous:

1. **Domain Foundation â†’ State Management**
   - Domain models provide the data structures that state containers manage
   - Business rules from the domain layer inform state transitions
   - Value objects ensure data integrity throughout the state

2. **State Management â†’ Navigation & Routing**
   - Navigation decisions depend on application state
   - Route protection requires authentication state
   - Deep links need state context for proper handling

3. **Navigation & Routing â†’ UI Components**
   - UI components receive context from navigation routes
   - Screen transitions follow navigation patterns
   - Component hierarchy reflects navigation structure

4. **UI Components â†’ Platform Integration**
   - UI components interact with platform-specific features
   - Error handling in UI connects to platform-specific recovery
   - Accessibility features leverage platform capabilities

### Lab Integration Strategy

Each day includes hands-on labs that reinforce lesson concepts:

- **Morning Labs**: Apply concepts from the morning lesson
- **Afternoon Labs**: Extend morning work with more advanced features
- **Progressive Complexity**: Labs build upon each other, creating a cohesive application
- **Real-World Scenarios**: Labs simulate actual PayPal development challenges

By the final day, students will have built a complete financial application with:
- Robust domain models and business logic
- Sophisticated state management
- Secure navigation and deep linking
- Professional UI components
- Platform-specific security features

### Why This Approach Matters for PayPal

This course structure directly addresses the unique challenges of financial application development:

- **Security First**: Security is built into the foundation, not added as an afterthought
- **Compliance Ready**: Architecture supports audit requirements and regulatory compliance
- **Enterprise Scale**: Patterns support the complexity of enterprise financial applications
- **Cross-Platform Consistency**: Core business logic remains consistent across platforms
- **Maintainable Codebase**: Clean architecture principles support long-term maintenance

By the end of this course, engineers will not only know how to build cross-platform mobile applications but will understand how to build them the right way for financial contextsâ€”with security, maintainability, and user experience as primary considerations.

## Target Audience
Backend engineers at PayPal who want to expand their skillset to include modern cross-platform mobile development.

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this course, students will be able to:
- Demonstrate a deep understanding of platform-dependent and platform-agnostic development approaches
- Build multi-screen applications with API integration, state management, and local storage
- Deploy cross-platform applications to both Google Play and Apple App Store
- Implement best practices for mobile app performance and usability
